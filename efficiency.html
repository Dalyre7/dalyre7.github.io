    <p class="mean">Not only is overconsumption bad for the environment, but it’s also detrimental to personal health. Perhaps you’re thinking, “how can buying things I like be bad for me”. So, allow me to expand.
        Buying a rare purchase, something you’ve wanted for a while and finally decided to treat yourself to, is not bad for you. However, that temporary dopamine release you get when opening something new and shiny, doesn’t last long. When it fades, some can start to crave it, and that’s when you can become addicted. Everyone’s heard of ‘retail therapy’, however the term usually extends further, usually to addiction of materialism. 
        
        
        On the scale, there are two opposing ends of people. Those who are not driven by materialism, they perhaps find comfort in minimalism and second-hand equities. They aren’t drawn to expensive cars and mansions, nor do they seek materialistic purchases for personal fulfilment. They may be considered low maintenance, be easily impressed or touched by small or hand-made gifts, or the occasional jewellery. But not be impressed by a £500 jacket made by a company that exploits children for profit. They do not seek artificial means of happiness, and know that using money as a form of emotional support is hazardous and temporary. Then on the other end, is those who find joy in splurging, and eventually become attached to the feeling, that they begin to feel empty between each purchase. Perhaps they find themselves scrolling through sites, looking for their next purchase. They justify their overconsumption, despite knowing it is not healthy. Eventually they have a house full of impulse-buys that serve no purpose to them. Only to realise after their tenth shopping spree that month, that no amount of Gucci is going to fill the void.
        
        
        Harsh? Maybe. My apologies.

        <p><b>Does overconsumption happen with tech too?</b><br>
            Of course it does. Although electronics are conventially useful, and undeniably needed in today's world, this doesn't exempt the same use of over-buying seen in other market areas. 
            The difference is in motive, the reason behind the purchase. Are you buying the new Apple product because you need it for work, banking, education? If so, it is a justifiable purchase,
            a necessary one. However, there are people (most people can name a few) that have an unjustified obession with having the 'latest tech'. Those who have an Iphone that works perfectly 
            fine, yet insist that they need the new £5000 IphoneXT5YZKK4. It's a first-world phenonmenom that baffles me greatly, and something that contributes to the ethics in tech.
            Is there really any human or enviromental ethics to impulse buying the new shiny product? No. The answer is obviously no. <br><br>
            <b>Do humans have a natural desire to spend money?</b><br>
            No, they have a lack of impulse control.<br><br>
            <b>Facts and statistics?</b><br>
